// Method Overriding
/*
before this we have seen method overloading (we can say compile time polymorphism to the method overloading)

# method overriding:    (object got create at run time so its a run time polymorphysm)
    - in java method overriding is a concept where one class contains 2 or more methods with same name and parameter
    - in java we can not create 2 or more methods with the same name and same parameters in one class
    - to perform overriding we requires at least 2 class in IS-A relationship       ,tip: what is IS-A relation -> inheritance is also called as IS-A relationship
    - for example vgo to the foldert name : Method Overriding and check the example

    - method overriding is a concept where we can execute method as per objec
    - in method overriding one method can be execute on the basic of object hence it is considered as a runtime polymorphysm
    - method overriding is useful for developer
    - to prevent method overriding we can declare method as final

    // Method overloading vs overriding
    
    // overloading                                                                                                              // overriding
    1) method overloading is a concept where one class contains 2 or more method with same name and different parameter         1)method overriding is a concept where 1 class contains 2 or more method with same name and parameter
    2)we can perform method overloading in one class                                                                            2) to perform method overriding requires 2 or more class in is-a relationship
    3)in method overloading method execute as per there paremeter                                                               3) in method overriding method can be execute as per there object
    4) method overloading can be considered as compile time polymorphysm                                                        4)  method overriding can be considered a run time polymorphysm 
    5) method overloading is useful for end-user                                                                                5)  method overriding is useful for developer
    6) we can not prevent method overloading                                                                                    6) to prevent  method overriding we can use final keyword
