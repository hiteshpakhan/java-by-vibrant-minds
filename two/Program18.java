//Encapsulation
/*
    - in java encapsulation is an concept where we can hide our data
    - encapsulation is also considered as a wraping of class
    - encapsulation also considered as a data binding 
    - to hide our data we can declare all properties as private
    - to initialllize private data we can use setter method
    - to get private data we can use getter method 
    - by using setter & getter method we can set or get individual properties of a class
    - to initiallize all variable directly we can use constructor
    - to reperesent all variable directly we can override toString method of object class
    - by using encapsulation class we can send data one end to other hence it is consoder as a model class
