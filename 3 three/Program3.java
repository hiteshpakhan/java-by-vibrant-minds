//polymorphysm theory
/*
    -in java polymorphysm is a concept where we can execute method differently
    - by using polymorphysh we can execute method as per requirement

Types of Polymorphism:
1) Compile-time polymorphysm
    - compile time polymorphism also known as an early or static binding
    - compile time polymorphism can be achive by using method overloading
    - in method overloading we can execute method as per therir parameter
    - compile-time polymorphism is useful for end user
    - we can not prevent compile time polymorphism

2) run time polymorphism 
    - run time  polymorphism  also known as a late or dynamic binding
    - runtime  polymorphism  can be achive by using method overriding
    - in method overriding we can execute method as per object
    - runtime polymorphism is useful for developer
    - to prevent run time polymorphism we can use final keyword
