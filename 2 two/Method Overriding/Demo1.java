class Demo1 {
    void m1(){  //overriden method 
        System.out.println("this is inside the m1 inside demo1 class");
    }
}




// you can make the method final to stop the overriding for example: final void m1(){...}
// or if you want that not even one method get override then you can simpley make the hole class final that will stop the class fron inheriting which also means the overriding is also stops example:final class Demo1
