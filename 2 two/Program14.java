// Inheritance:
/*

    - in java inheritance is a concept where we can reuse our code
    - due to inheritancewe can remove code complexicity 
    - in inheritance a class which aquire elements from other class considered as a child
    - in inheritance a class which provides elements to other class considered as a parent
    - to perform inheritance we can use extends keyword
    - example: here go to the inheritance folder and see the MainClass.java
    - inheritance also considered as an IS-A relationship


---------------------------------

types of inheritance

    1) Single Inheritance:
        - example: here go to the inheritance folder and see the MainClass.java
        - in single inheritance one parent class can have only one child classand vicew-versa
    
    2) Multi-level Inheritance:
        - in multi level inheritance one parent class can be child of other class
        - in multi level inheritance a class that not contain parent class considered as a root class 
        - in multi- level inheritance a class dosent contains child class considered as a child or leaf class   
        - Note: parent class of root class considered as a super class eg: object class

    3) Hierarchical inheritance 
        - in hierarchical inheritance one parent class can have 2 or more child class and vice-versa
        - in hirerchical inheritance we can not invoke method of subsidiary class
        
    4) Multiple inheritance (not possible in java)  //because each class has object class by default 
        - in multiple inheritance one class have 2 or more parent class and vice versa
        - java allows to extends one class at a time hence multiple inheritance is supported 
        - java dosent support multiple inheritance due to method ambiugious
        
    5) hybrid inheritance (not possible in java)
        - it is a combination of multiple and multilevel inheritance 
        - hybrid inheritance is not supported because it contains multiple inheritance
    
    6) Cyclic Inheritance (not possible in java)
        - in cyclic inheritance one parent class is a child of same class and vice versa
        - cyclic inheritance is not supported due to method ambigious
